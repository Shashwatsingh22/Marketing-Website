# Marketing-Website
This project is based on the marketing website...
Web marketing is the process of using the Internet to market your business. It includes the use of social media, search engines, blogging, videos, and email.

Promoting a business takes effort. There are a variety of ways to do it. Traditional advertising in newspapers, on the radio and television, direct mail, and billboards has been around for decades.

Web marketing takes your message to the big wide web. With tons of people using the internet every day, there are huge opportunities to get your product or service in front of people who need or want it.

Drilling down into it, web marketing takes many forms. Banner ads, email promotions, and social media posting are three of the ones you have probably heard about. They, and more, live under the “web marketing” umbrella.
